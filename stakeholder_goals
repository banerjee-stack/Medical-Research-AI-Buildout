# Overview
Documentation of stakeholder goals and the discrete actions taken by consultant to satisfy them.
PI: Director of residents/primary stakeholder
Research Consultant: CRBanerjee (repo owner)
Engineering Lead: Python specialist/primary code integration manager

1. PI goal: Define needs for current product buildout
- Evaluation criteria: Meets usability criteria; teaches residents data and analysis basics; produces clinically valid interpretations; engineering handoff is actionable for the receiving team.
- Consultant action: Identified current strengths and weaknesses including the scrope of consultant; set up UXR evaluation; performed research and data evaluation; translated stakeholder goals into technical requirements and collaborated with engineering to define scope and deliverables for a 24‑week handoff

2. PI goal: Ensure pedagogically appropriate learning modules
- Evaluation criteria: clear learning objectives; scaffolded flow (intro → practice → assessment); end‑of‑lesson checks pass at target; basic accessibility met.
- Consultant action: defined objectives mapped to competencies and translate to instructional design principles; created scaffolded module template; embedded quick checks and rubrics; ran pilot walkthrough and prioritized fixes

3. PI goal: Reduce novice comprehension barriers
- Evaluation criteria: novices complete core tasks with no major confusion
- Consultant: applied cognitive‑science and instructional‑design principles; simplified language, added worked examples and plain‑language callouts; ran small moderated sessions and iterated.

4. Conduct UXR to validate learnability and interpretability
- Evaluation criteria: UX/UI principles
- Consultant action: small moderated sessions completed; evaluative rubrics with scores, prioritized findings with fixes to meet thresholds

4. PI goal: Identify relevant analyses to medical student and resident needs
- Evaluation criteria: prioritized list of 5–15 analysis types mapped to common learning/reporting tasks; each analysis includes purpose, assumptions, and typical output format.
- Consultant action: researched clinical reporting conventions; surveyed resident learning needs; drafted and validated a prioritized list of 5–15 target analyses.

5. PI goal: Make analyses teachable to residents
- Evaluation criteria: Residents can explain the analysis and reproduce key steps in a multi-armed walkthrough
- Consultant action: Added or revised inline micro‑tutorials, example walkthrough cells, and end‑of‑lesson tests in the example notebook

6. PI goal: Protect PHI
- Evaluation criteria: processing and redaction steps documented; no PHI present in repo artifacts; each run records minimal audit fields.
- Consultant action: added concise inline instructions for deidentified data handling; authored redaction checklist, synthetic data with annotation

7. PI goal: Runnable analyses with artifacts
- Evaluation criteria: product guides users through the data lifecycle and produces user‑friendly, report‑ready language outputs.
- Consultant action: created user‑action walkthrough and product manual skeleton using synthetic data; audited outputs against manual analytic baseline; iterated with engineering to refine outputs.
- Owners: Research Consultant (Bekah) & Engineering Lead

8. PI goal: Fit into clinical workflow, stakeholder signoff, rollout handoff
- Evaluation criteria: Director confirms outputs meet basic clinical needs for pilot and provides sign‑off.
- Consultant action: Mapped goals to clear acceptance checks and acceptance checklist for pilot; prepared rollout handoff materials for review
- Owners: Research Consultant and PI
