FUNCTION,Criteria,Dimension(s),Successes,Needs Improvement,Rating (1-5),Notes
Dashboard Interface,Sign-in Features,"Functional and Intuitive, Efficient",Secure and efficient authentication flow; persistent credential storage enabled; rapid sign‑in path minimizes user wait time,Occasional mid‑workflow session expirations requiring re‑authentication; insufficient session continuity during module completion,5,
,Dashboard,Functional and Intuitive,"Easy to read layout, completion bars are helpful and accurate",,4,
,Password Recovery,"Functional and Intuitive, Efficient",n/a,Missing,1,
Learning Modules,1,"Accessible, Ease of Use","Clean, high‑contrast visuals; responsive, scalable text supporting readability across devices",Abrupt question transitions causing change blindness; unclear quiz grading timing and feedback,3,
,2,"Accessible, Comprehensive, Engaging",Reliable audio‑visuals; scalable text and concise sentence structure that support comprehension; content accuracy maintained,Minor color‑contrast issues; mislabeled micro‑tutorial (Section 10) that may confuse learners,5,
,3,"Accessible, Ease of Use","Readable layout and clear navigation for most of the module""",Persistent change blindness from question transitions; module terminates with a 404 error preventing completion,1,
Principles of Research,Ideation and Initialization,"Functional and Intuitive, Efficient","Clear, scannable task list with explicit status indicators for Started and Completed; supports straightforward task tracking.",Inconsistent label formatting (TODO vs To‑Do); lack of in‑line validation and feedback mechanisms for task accuracy; unclear guidance for returning to and marking specific items complete,4,
,Ideation and Initialization,"Engaging, Comprehensive",Questions are clearly phrased and sequenced to support ideation flow; encourages focused completion,,5,
,Study Design,"Functional and Intuitive, Efficient",Logical sequencing and readable presentation that guide users through design steps.,No clear affordance for revisiting specific questions to update completion status; consider explicit “resume/return to” cues.,4,
,Study Design,"Engaging, Comprehensive",Keeps users on task with concise prompts and step confirmations for each analysis step.,"Missing explicit request for key statistical inputs (e.g., power calculation); add targeted prompts where domain‑specific values are required.",4,
,Ethical and privacy considerations,"Functional and Intuitive, Efficient",Overall flow is understandable and aligns with common IRB question framing.,Certain answer combinations fail to surface a definitive IRB requirement or update item status; implement deterministic logic and state updates for all response permutations.,2,
,Ethical and privacy considerations,"Engaging, Comprehensive","Questions are appropriate and easy to comprehend, supporting informed responses.",,5,
Statisical Analysis,Select Analysis,"Functional and Intuitive, Efficient","Clear, well‑organized dropdown options with readable labels that support quick selection of analysis type",No unified option for generating descriptive statistics across mixed variable types; unclear guidance for selecting the correct analysis when dependent/independent variable types differ,3,
,Define the Data,"Functional and Intuitive, Efficient",Smooth upload flow with clear instructions; headers parsed correctly and fast file handling,Learn about variables' diagram lacks contextual guidance and does not map to available analysis options; introduces confusion for novice users,4,data quality returned with improperly formatted CSV: UKNOWN
,Perform Analysis ,"Functional and Intuitive, Efficient","Fast execution with distinct, well‑structured result sections that surface key outputs quickly","Workflow forces data re‑upload to change analysis type and retains prior state in view, creating ambiguity about which results are current",4,output readability and validity ( separate report )
,Interpret Analysis,"Functional and Intuitive, Efficient",Concise interpretation panel with clear progress indicators that show processing status,"Prior interpretations remain visible after switching analyses or re‑uploading data, risking accidental reuse of stale interpretations and user confusion",4,output readability and validity ( separate report )
