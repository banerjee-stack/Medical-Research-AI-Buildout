# Research-Product-Build-Out
Rapid buildout to define user needs, perform exploratory processing of usability data and UXR‑principles evaluation, synthesize prioritized insights, produce lightweight prototypes and reproducible analysis artifacts, and hand off clear requirements to engineering and rollout teams.
# Product Summary 
An all‑in‑one AI learning and analysis assistant for medical students and research residents that streamlines data preprocessing, variable discovery, analysis selection, and interpretation. Users upload or connect deidentified datasets; the system asks targeted questions to profile data and variable types, define appropriate analytic methods, and finally will run analyses and deliver clear report-ready interpretations of data.
# Primary users and value
Target users: medical students, clinical research residents, and early‑stage clinician‑researchers
Value: reduces technical barriers to data analysis; accelerate learning by making analytic choices explicit; produce output that can be inspected, reproduced, and shared with supervisor
# Key Product Needs
**Educational scaffolding**: inline tips, micro-tutorials, inductive reasoning to define data steps and support learning, user (learner) experience optimized
**Safety and compliance**: guides to deidentification inline with instructions, system privacy, and auditable steps for reproducibility
**Generative interpretation**: plain language summaries as well as report-ready language

# Current Status: Handoff
Handoff to rollout team for Fall semester — handoff complete; pilot deployment window: Aug–December; rollout owner: (__); pilot cohort: 1 residency program; access: internal; next milestone TBD: second iteration user feedback, internal revisions and second rollout.

## 🧭 UX Evaluation Rubric

This rubric is used to assess the usability, clarity, and overall quality of a design, prototype, or digital product.  
Each dimension includes a guiding question to evaluate user experience quality.
